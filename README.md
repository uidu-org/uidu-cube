You'd probably run this as a service inside uidu main repo with

```
docker-compose up cube
```

## Maintainers

[@uidu_org](https://github.com/uidu_org)

## Contributing

When you're working on the uidu-core repo, on a new branch, the submodule is detached from this main repo.
In order to avoid conflicts, you should run the following command:

```
git fetch
git checkout -b <new-branch-name> origin/main
```

Then add your changes and commit them as usual.
